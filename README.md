# Espial
Block logging plugin for SpongeAPI for viewing player interactions with blocks (i.e who broke or placed a block)

Inspired by the likes of [CoreProtect](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/coreprotect.8631/) and [Prism](https://github.com/Libter/SpongePrism).

## Requirements
* Java 21
* SpongeAPI 12 (Minecraft 1.21)

## Command Usage
* **/espial | /es**
  * Base command. If no subcommand is specified, defaults to an info screen (**/espial info**)
  * **lookup | l [start x y z] [end x y z]**
    * Looks up specific coordinates, or a range. Defaults to the block you are looking at.
  * **lookup worldedit|we**
    * Looks up your WorldEdit selection as a region.
  * **inspect | i \<id\>**
    * Looks up a specific ID.
